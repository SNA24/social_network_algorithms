        Dictionary whose keys are strings each identifying a different bidder and whose

        key reports the information about the auction.

        Dictionary whose keys are strings each identifying a different bidder and whose
        values are numbers defining the bid of the bidder identified by that key.

    allocation : dict
        Dictionary that has as keys the strings identifying each of the bidders
        that submitted a bid, and as value a boolean True if this bidder is allocated one of the items,

        Dictionary that has as keys the strings identifying each of the bidders that
        submitted a bid, and as value the price that she pays. Here, a positive price 
        means that the bidder is paying to the seller, while a negative price means that 
        the seller is paying to the bidder.
